              I know this pic is not clear but it means the world to me, so The first time I saw
              you, it felt like the world paused for just a moment just enough for me to notice that
              something extraordinary have come into my life. You weren‚Äôt just another face in the
              crowd(bingo) you were the kind of presence that have huge impact, the kind that makes
              everything else seem quieter, softer, almost invisible. I didn‚Äôt know then what I know
              now that meeting you wasn‚Äôt just a coincidence. I all part of universie and desitny,
              It was the beginning of something the universe had been writing long before we even
              knew how to read it. Since that day, the sky has felt wider, the nights a little less
              lonely, and time has become my greatest enemy because no matter how much of it I get
              with you, it never feels enough. You don‚Äôt have to ask, you don‚Äôt have to wonder I
              will always be here, in the spaces between your thoughts, in the quiet moments, in
              every tomorrow. Happy birthday, my love. You are my favorite part of this life.

              Ahh.. what can I say about this, I'm gonna go with the girl a my dream, so beautyful
              classy, pretty and above all her sensitive nature, caring nature and how she take
              organize every small things. It's like a dream for me my soul so like freezing like
              everytime I thought about my first meet and it happened. Like they show in the movie
              and even more romantic than that. I won't say it was perfect I would say it was what
              every guy dreams about and I was in the reality, I was in that place just beside her.
              Just thinking about that makes me wanna go back again and relieve that moment. But yes
              we are far and as I always say it's temporary and being together is the permanent.
              Thank you for being you and always like this more goofy more strong, always keep on
              smiling I will always try to make u smile. Happy birthday my baby I love a lot.

              Guy who was not serious about his daily, I was just about having fun everyday and lost
              in life and a girl came and changed everything now she is not just a girl but a
              fairytale that changed everything into reality. She taught me about living life in
              different perceptive, doing things in right time on specific things. Being rational,
              not to make rush decisions, be decisive and be bold. We spent a great time in office I
              will always be thankful for that cause I met u there we shared a special bond even in
              resticted conditon. I remember the times that u use to send me music I would just
              listen to it write my code and text u everything at the same time. That's the power of
              being with right person. I loved you when we were together I love you when we are in
              distance and I will always love you till the end.

              and the place we didn't care about others. Just u me and the invisible world along
              with my letter, I had a reply of your one of the fav song. I still rememeber looking

              What is fear? I lost that day when I decided to go on a trip with you to Thailand.
              Nobody in my home knew where I actually went hahah, if it was with friends or anyone I
              could never. We created the best memories of our life holding our hands walking in the
              beach, ride high speed scooter, living and eating everday together and it was like we
              were already in our honeymoon. But above that we talked, we shared things we taught
              each other about daily like, we had a conversation that we never had, we started
              knowing each alot more. It was all worth it. You make things worth it, you have that
              magic you have that charm and aura. It's so smooth you won't see it but feel when
              everyday passes by. I will always remember those days and keep in my heart forever no
              matter how many trips we take I will always remeber it forever. You were born in 1999
              that led me to visit thailand in 2024, happy birthday my motki I love you till moon
              and back.

              I hate this word, distance. I hate it so bad if I get a power one day to change things
              in dictionary then I will just remove it and make it illegal. No matter how much I
              hate it we lived with it and that made our bond even more stronger than ever. Maybe
              it's the test that universe it taking, it's not always a bad things. We kept being
              with each other no matter how far we are. The best thing about it is being together
              again. The more I thing about seeing you, the more I get exceited and even a code
              stone looks beautiful when I imagine my life living with you. That's the power of
              changing our time from long distance to living togerther and it so beautiful. I want
              to say it's just few more days or months, and we will meet we will have good times
              like before or even more better. Good times are waiting for US and things will start
              making sense on why we had to live apart for some time. I love you in distance and I
              will love you when we are together, Happy Birthday to love of my life!
